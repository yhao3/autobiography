# Autobiography

My name is Yang Shang-Hao (Hao), and _"progress every day"_ is my commitment to myself since entering the IT industry almost a year ago.

# Educational Experience

During my academic years, I excelled in mathematics and went on to teach and tutor the subject. After completing my military service in April 2021, I delved into the IT industry, initially by taking an online course and then self-studying Java and SQL. To connect with the industry more quickly, I enrolled in TibaMe's Java class where I served as a team leader and worked on a pet platform project. Through this experience, I improved my teamwork skills and gained a deeper understanding of technical knowledge, ultimately leading to my successful entry into the IT industry in April 2022.

# Work Experience

## Hard Skills

As a backend engineer for nearly a year, I have accumulated rich practical experience due to the relatively flat structure of the team I work with and the space for growth provided by my supervisor. My experience includes:

1. Building projects using [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) and [Maven](https://github.com/apache/maven).
2. Developing RESTful APIs using the [Spring MVC](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework) framework.
3. Using [Spring Data JPA](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-jpa) as the data persistence layer.
4. Enhancing Spring Data JPA with [Qureydsl](https://github.com/querydsl/querydsl) framework to achieve type-safe complex queries, improving code readability and maintainability.
5. Using AOP to handle error validation uniformly.
6. Managing cache using [Ehcache](https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3) to reduce the overhead of redundant database queries.
7. Implementing Excel export functionality using [Apache POI](https://github.com/apache/poi).
8. Writing unit and integration tests using [JUnit](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5) and [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito).
9. Version controlling the database using [Liquibase](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase).
10. Practicing [GitLab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) to implement a streamlined workflow.
11. Building CI/CD using GitLab and Docker.

## Soft Skills

### Independent Thinking and Problem Solving

To address the limitations of complex queries in Spring Data JPA, I proposed to introduce the Querydsl framework to the project, which successfully implemented complex queries more elegantly on top of JPA.

### Learning Agility and Team Collaboration

Has a habit of continuous learning, supplementing knowledge through Open Course Ware and recording what is learned in electronic notes. 
Proposed introducing Obsidian to the team to manage knowledge assets and has helped the team accumulate dozens of technical and learning notes.

# Special Achievements

I believe that participating in the open source community is a continuous learning and growth process. Therefore, in my free time, I share simple demo projects on GitHub and help open source projects by submitting pull requests. For example, I once submitted a documentation modification PR ([`#2400`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-elasticsearch/pull/2400)) to the Spring Data Elasticsearch project and it was successfully merged. Although it was just a simple few-word modification, it allowed me to experience the fun and sense of accomplishment of collaboration and contribution!
